# C Modules

Our C project template, to fight [blank page syndrome](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/scalable-c/content/chapter2.html).

## Install

Dependencies:

- `libx11`:
  - debian: `sudo apt install libx11-dev`
  - ubuntu: `sudo apt install libx11-dev`

Compile:

```
git clone https://github.com/cicada-lang/c-modules
cd c-modules
make -j
make test
```

The compiled binary `./bin/app` is the command-line program.

## Development

```shell
make all      # compile src/ files to lib/ and bin/
make run      # compile and run the command-line program
make test     # compile and run test
make clean    # clean up compiled files
```
